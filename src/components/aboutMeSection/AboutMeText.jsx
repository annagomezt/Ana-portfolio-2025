      <p>
      I’m Ana, a web developer with a passion for coding and continuous learning. Currently, I work as both a front-end and back-end developer at Nexus, where I'm involved in various projects that combine the latest technologies and real-world applications. I’m always learning and expanding my skills, particularly in full-stack development. Outside of coding, I enjoy sharing knowledge, contributing to my community, and inspiring others to pursue their goals in tech.
